== Steampunk Curse Generator

Next time you are at a loss for impolite words, let technology help you live up to your offensive potential! Your curse is twitter-able too*. Just poke the blue bird and enrage the entire twitterverse. Tell your friends, family and co-workers! Or better yet, just surprise them with colorful language in your next email or conversation. They will be delighted.

\*Note: if you have ad-blocking enabled, your curse might not appear to be twitter-able. For full fun and functionality, consider disabling your ad blocker for the Steampunk Curse Generator -- we have no ads to block anyway!
